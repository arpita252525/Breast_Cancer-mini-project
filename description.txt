Breast Cancer Classification Project

This project uses the Breast Cancer Dataset from Kaggle (by Yasser H) to classify tumors as Malignant (M) or Benign (B) based on cell nuclei features. 
It includes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), model training, and a Streamlit web app for live predictions.

Dataset Details:
- Source: Kaggle (yasserh/breast-cancer-dataset)
- Samples: 569
- Features: 30 numeric + 1 target (diagnosis)
- Target: M = Malignant, B = Benign

Key Features:
- radius_mean, texture_mean, perimeter_mean, area_mean, smoothness_mean, compactness_mean, concavity_mean, concave points_mean, symmetry_mean, fractal_dimension_mean, etc.

Project Steps:
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature correlation and visualization
4. Model building using Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, and KNN
5. Model evaluation and accuracy comparison
6. Streamlit app (app.py) for user interaction and live tumor prediction

Result:
Achieved over 95% accuracy in classifying tumors correctly.
